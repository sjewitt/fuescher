# F*ck you, Escher!

An experimental level showing portal usage and some trickery with floor heights. Loosely inspired by various MC Escher pictures.



FLOORS:







vertical portals (line special = 57) between floors:

 - make line portal puzzle with curvesÂ· Need to plan this one...
 - need drawing (gdoc etc)

 - each central branch allows view into central column (which is a sector portal) except the exit.

THIS WORKS. Add direction flag to OTHER side of portal

TODO:


All Keys needed to access highest three floors (need to add another floor). Each accessed floor 
has a switch that will open part of the exit cage.


18/09/2020:
-----------
 - recursive spiral stair. 			X
 - look OUT through top from window(s)?
 - WTF with the fly thing?
 - continue library
	- make central portal a stair (gate at top so cannot go UP until got key)?


library window logic:
---------------------
type 1, visual only?
1: library window from inside
	looking out, target SHED

2: library window from OUTSIDE
	look up from floor, looking IN, see library interior

3: SHED window from outside
	looking IN, see library interior

line IDs:
library window (ext)	62
library window (int)	61
shed window		60



09:47 19/09/2020
------------------

 - 3-way thrick for keys viewing
 - need yellow key!!!
 - add windows on all upper blocks
 - add corresponding windows
 - LINE PORTAL TABLE!!!
 - try Escher waterfall
 - LINE portal from library to other sector floor? (STAIRS??)

 - Make courtyard portals into a U shape thing... Have one window that actually looks through, just to confuse.

haha - make the return from the lava pit a portal to the lava pit!!!
 - done, need to add an exit and HIDE the secret door..

 - need to add lights everywhere.


11:12 24/09/2020
-----------------

door at 72, -1696 needs to be triggered remotely. Tag=102


sort out blue and yellow keys:
 - order not yet correct... I need to get the YELLOW key last.


10:53 25/09/2020
----------------

Escape via 1st level of red key?



Library lower drop-through logic??TODO


Inaccessible bits of tower - make secret?
 - add jaw things, but closed - so you cant jump n by mistake
 - add switch n one to lower jaws of other so you can escape again.
 - add secretty thking
 - make iron/blood themed?

OK - lower RH is target for secret portal (where??). This has jaw-things but UP. Another 


18:58 27/09/2020
----------------
final secret puzzle:
1: arrive at NW tele dest
 - Drop into lower area (E)
 - bottom area switch opens spiral area button (S) ALSO opens beasts in lower area (NE) 
2: teleport back up
 - activate South switch (drops teeth AND West switch)
 - drop down to exit area or:
 - activate East swicth to open sectret secret tele (NNW),


28/09/2020:
-----------
make super-secret level lava with cage all around
 - actually sky and metal.

TODO:
-----
library upper 
	- stair wall texture -grey
	- bok column align
 	- Lower door and flag with flicker or similar
	- doortrak!!!

big stair upper
	- adjust light


Need to add final secret source teleporter. From exit room

 - fall all the way back, but give LOADS of ammo etc. Monster closets openin cellar and 1st floor (and possibly others?) to make a big fucking battle on the way out
	- need teleporter rather than portal from  -1760,-1736 to LIBRARY UPPER UPPER secret. Only if you get to the last secret will monster closets tigger (you can get out before, by dropping down foorm secret area 1)


 - crossing tele exit line in secret area opens all lower monster closets.
 - crossing SUPER SECRET tele exit opens more? (archvile?)

 - add monser closet to lava area too


Unfinished tunnel in main area nees to go somewhere...

Also - add beams under roofs.

monsters in library lower. Trigger MORE on switching in small office	DONE
monster in sewer closet (dormant??)					DONE
redo lights on sewer top!!!						DONE
blue key!!! WTF?							DONE
health in library window						DONE
textue in cellar closet							DONE
circle puzzle - monsters around corners					DONE
soul sphere needs to be a secret					DONE
library upper - door to lower needs to be better flagged, 		DONE
	and adjust ceiling texture!!!
sewer texture AGAIN!!!							DONE
another dormant monster in cellar					DONE
move monster away from portal - wierd things if use chainsaw 		DONE
	(its teh yellow ket bit exit)		
mark switch in library lower room					DONE
improve circle exit...
corridor windowsills - too bright					
blue and rfed main door target sector too bright

tele target too narrow for cacos. Change to skulls
tele spot to left of library lower small room exit not placed correctly?
sewer missed a water lfat!!
spectre stuck in super secret area by switch
shells under  corner - need to raise.
better deoms in final ssecret closets, LINK the closets so you don't need to bugger about with the portals 
mid door main silo - adjust floor from metal



 - adjust cirle puzzle to use alt door face rather than candles. Might be clearer...
Also, portals need to be CLOSER to the doors!


REVISIT THIS!!!:
 - Lighted candles flag the correct route
	- may be back the way you came...
 - each central branch allows view into central column (which is a sector portal) except the exit.

TODO: I might be able to do it such that the candle you need to follow is ALREADY lit on passing throuh the portal, and STAYS lit (basically, play with the visibility of candle either side of he portal - you will be seeing DIFFERENT candles of course, but as you gp through the portal it will remain lit etc. TODO)


09:24 04/10/2020:
-----------------

 - Make archvile area better combat - ie allow backing out wirhout portal getting in he way.
 - Can I improve the main entry doors in this way?
 - SKY PORTALS!!! :ook nto why loking DOWN fails... Is this just because the space behind the door is too ig? ALSO, are any of them on SAME level so I can use interactive portal
 - DEBUG console mesages!
	Set up logging to text file

BUG
bottom main door:
portal def: 156, 60,61,1,2

Grab red key - opens a closet, force you to run for the baron door... - OK

wierd bug between wheel portals between line IDs 1102 and 1300. "Link offset mismatch between sectors 218 and 277" not sure why...

Console otpu:


Unknown bottom texture '-W' on first side of linedef 4077
Unknown bottom texture '-W' on first side of linedef 4099
Link offset mismatch between sectors 218 and 277


These texture errors are also not ctually there. WTF 


 - Make top exit from silo longer so you don't back out into the circle maze - OK
 - put SSG at silo exit not CGUN -  OK
 - soulspher sector, flag as secret - OK
 - check library lower secret is accessible!! - OK
 - exit from lava GREY1 textures. FIX - OK
 - health in lava trap - OK


 - Check main door floor tex!!
 - SILO EXIT TEXTURE!!!!!!!
 - yellow key seer wate tex!! - OK
 - add exit line action
 - add barons to final trap
